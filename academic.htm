### VALIDATION ###
This page and corresponding CSS have been checked on the W3c HTML5 and CSS3 
validator and have passed I chose not to include the badge purely for stylistic 
reasons.

### PRE-Processing of CSS ###
CSS on this site was generated from a SASS (ScSS) preprocessor which I can 
supply if needed. I haven't done so since it's outside the scope of the 
assignment marking system. I would normally remove unneeded CSS as part of 
the build process and compress for speed but since this is being marked, I've 
left it verbose.

                    <p>The visit to MHR was great. We had a few talks which were interesting and finished with a great activity session using Lego bricks to show how Agile development cycles work. Was a good day, made a few networking contacts, learned some new things and had fun.</p>

                    <p>The talk was a little basic but considering we are first years, that’s to be expected. I didn’t learn much that I didn’t know but it was a great opportunity to chat to the employers a little in terms of networking and finding out whether they could be potential employers in future.</p>

                    <h4>What have I gained from this activity?</h4>
                    <p>I attended this course to help with my Academic Writing. The course was run by Angela Donaldson. Coming from a Web background, I'm not used to writing in this style and was struggling a little. This course was really helpful and I learned a lot about paraphrasing and essay layout. The slides were made available afterward which was really useful.</p>

                    <h4>What have I gained from this activity?</h4>
                    <p>I booked and attended a few appointments to get help with the report assignment for Essential Skills. I booked with Angela Donaldson mainly since i had spent time with her on the course and felt familiar. These sessions have been great because I was able to ask for specific help with areas I was struggling with and was given lots of additional advice on how to approach the task. This helped enormously with the report writing and I eventually managed to hand in something I was really happy with.</p>

                    <p>These are a great opportunity to get information regarding tests and general tips. I feel that, in general, I don’t have a huge amount of questions that need answering so the usefulness is somewhat limited. However they have been extremely useful on occasion, especially regarding information on testing procedures from the mentor who has obviously been through them before.</p>

I spoke to the lady from MHL who I met again at the interview practice session during Digital Horizons week.</p>

                    <h4>What did I do?</h4>
                    <p>I attended the Mock Interviews during Digital Horizons week.</p>
                    <h4>When did this take place?</h4>
                    <p>I attended on the 14thh of November<p>
                    <h4>What have I gained from this activity?</h4>
                    <p>I met with the interviewer (who turned out to be the lady from MMT Digital that I’d spoken to at the job fair) so it was a nice ice breaker to begin with. Was a good interview and I did really well but there were a couple of suggestions which would have made my answers more rounded or fuller so this was really useful.</p>
